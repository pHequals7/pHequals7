## Hey! I'm Pranav Hari,
Currently a foot soldier in the Indian startup ecosystem via Lightspeed India. Used to be a management consultant prior to which an undergrad-postgrad mishmash at IIT-Madras. On paper, I majored in Civil and Environmental Engineering, but my interests also lie in the intersection of Data, Digital Products, and Innovation
